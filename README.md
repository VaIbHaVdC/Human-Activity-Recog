# Human-Activity-Recog
 Its a Project to predict the human activity on the basis of various parameters collecred by the sensors presented in the smartphone carried by people.
 The dataset contains six classes of activity :
      1. WALKING
      2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
      3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
      4. SITTING
      5. STANDING
      6. LAYING
      
 For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

This is an attempt to apply Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Feed  forward neural network to do the classification job.
The accuraies obtained on the cross validation set as provided along the training data are 95.5%, 98.3% and 99.5% for the respective models.
